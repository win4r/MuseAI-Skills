# Voice Catalog Data

This directory exists only to ship `voice_source.json`, the system voice catalog
consumed by Jarvis. It does not define a user-facing voice workflow.

Do not use this skill to handle voice requests, choose voices, or create widgets.
Follow the active agent instructions and use `muse.voice_options` for voice
selection and design.
