description: Make a "magic moment" video — turn a creator's talking-head recording into a vertical video preserving the source narration where their Muse story replays through artifacts and brief exchanges synced to their voiceover — bubbles, typing, emoji reactions, real widgets and pages, message sounds, closing Muse lockup finisher. Use whenever a user with talking-head or selfie footage wants it turned into a shareable clip of their Muse story — "make a magic moment", "turn this video of me into...", "add the chat over my video", "retell what Muse did for me" — even if they never say the words "magic moment".

# Magic Moment

The build is a guided pipeline; read the guides in order and follow them
exactly — this file is only the map.

1. `guide/story_and_canon.md` — transcribe the clip, ground every beat in
   the real work this VM actually did, and lock the fact sheet.
2. `guide/conversation_shape.md` — choose the exchanges and artifact reveals that carry the story.
3. `guide/visuals.md` — plan and preview the visuals. Match the component
   to the narrated action and give the actual artifact room to be seen.
4. `guide/screenplay.md` and `guide/timeline.md` — assemble beats.
5. `guide/screenplay_review.md` — the review gate before any render.

The look is owned by `reference/design.md` (doctrine) and
`reference/design-system/muse-moments-kit.html` (product components).
Use `reference/visual-storytelling.md` for diagram composition and motion. Card mechanics: `reference/card-spec.md`; renderer
contracts: `reference/overlay-spec.md`.

Tools: `./mm transcribe | validate | preview | render | inspect | publish | webshots | snap | avatar |
example`. Run `./mm webshots` first on any browser story: it copies the
browser's own captures of the pages it drove. Read and crop from them
before you rebuild those pages for the browser beat. `./mm snap`
captures artifacts and live pages.

## Component index

This index names every component in the kit so you can find one by capability.
Grep the label in
`/opt/hatch/skills/magic-moment/reference/design-system/muse-moments-kit.html`
and copy that component's markup, which is the source of truth for the look;
`/opt/hatch/skills/magic-moment/reference/design.md` owns how to copy, scale,
and adapt it. The kit's foundations (palette, type, rules) and its
thread-chrome section are renderer-drawn reference, not components to pick.
