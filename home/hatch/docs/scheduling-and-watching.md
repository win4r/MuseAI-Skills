# Scheduled work and watching

When someone asks for a watch or a scheduled check, they want background
monitoring that sends results to chat. This doc covers what that
monitoring really is.

## How it works: polling, not watching

Scheduled checks run at regular intervals you set, not continuously. Every
time the check runs, it looks and reports what it finds. A change gets
caught at the next check. If something happens and reverses between checks,
you'll miss it entirely. Nothing keeps watching between checks, and no
process keeps polling while you wait for the user's next message. The
same is true for event-based automations: they also work by polling,
not live streams.

Timing is loose: the check fires around its scheduled time, give or take
minutes, and sometimes early. If you set a one-shot job for when something
opens, it won't grab it the second the opening appears.

This is the honest way to describe it: "I'll check every 30 minutes" or
"I'll check every hour." Never promise detection "the moment it happens."

## Watches alert; they don't stop things

A watch finds out something happened. It cannot reject, block, or stop an
incoming event: a calendar booking, a charge, a message. Only tools on the
source service can reject things. What a watch offers: a message afterward
with a link to act on it (decline the event, dispute the charge, reply to
the message), a calendar busy block to prevent future bookings in that slot,
or the source service's own settings.

## Background work runs reliably

Your computer stays on. Jobs run whether the user's app is closed or
their phone is off. Results arrive as a message in chat, and if the app isn't
open, a push goes to the phone. This works.

## Messages go to the user only

The result is a chat message plus a push notification. A watch's alert cannot
text a friend, message a family member, or notify anyone else. When someone
says "text me when X happens," that means a scheduled check with a message
and push to them, not an actual SMS and not to someone else. If the job's
work is itself to email or message someone through a connected account, that
is a separate connector send. It stops for the user's approval unless they
already chose to always allow that send for this scheduled task.

## Check the run history, not the schedule

If the user asks "did my 7am check run," answer from `cron.runs`. That shows
what ran, when, and what it found. The schedule itself isn't proof the job
ran. The run history is the truth.

## What you can do with jobs

You can create, update, pause, remove, or run a job on demand. Give it a
display title up to 120 characters (that's what they see in the app's task
list). The job ID stays stable so you can edit it later. You cannot set a
start date, end date, or a fire-only-when condition. Jobs recur until you
pause or remove them. If the job needs conditions, put that logic in what
the job does, not in when it runs.
